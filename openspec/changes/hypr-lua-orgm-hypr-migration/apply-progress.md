# Apply Progress: hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration

## Workload / PR boundary

- Delivery path: auto-chain approved by parent/user.
- Applied PR slices: Slice 1 (inventory + Go CLI test harness), Slice 2 (Lua foundation), Slice 3 (compositor parity), Slice 4 (Session, Waybar, Dock CLI), Slice 5 (Windows, Zen, OSD CLI), Slice 6 (Menu, smart-run, webapp), and Slice 7 (cleanup decision, docs, partial verification).
- Current stop point: after Slice 7. User requested stop after Slice 7.
- PR boundary: Slice 7 performs documentation and final partial verification only. Because manual Hyprland parity, `nix`, `orgm-dot`, and project `./dot.sh` verification are blocked, no script deletion, shrinking, caller migration, dotfile sync, or cleanup was performed.

## Completed tasks

- [x] 1.1 Refresh migration inventory without behavior changes.
- [x] 1.2 Add Go CLI test harness before new command behavior.
- [x] 2.1 Characterize current Lua/hyprlang load structure before refactor.
- [x] 2.2 Add or normalize Lua module tree additively.
- [x] 3.1 Migrate/validate keybindings through Lua without removing shell entrypoints.
- [x] 3.2 Migrate/validate monitor, input, look/layout, windows, and workspace rules.
- [x] 4.1 Add `orgm-hypr session` characterization tests, then implementation.
- [x] 4.2 Add `orgm-hypr waybar` tests and commands with wrappers retained.
- [x] 4.3 Add `orgm-hypr dock` tests and command with compatibility wrapper.
- [x] 5.1 Add `orgm-hypr windows` tests and commands before wrapper switch.
- [x] 5.2 Add `orgm-hypr zen` tests and command.
- [x] 5.3 Add `orgm-hypr osd` tests and commands with wrappers retained.
- [x] 6.1 Characterize menu wrappers before optional Go migration.
- [x] 6.2 Add `orgm-hypr smart-run` parser tests, then implementation or wrapper delegation.
- [x] 6.3 Characterize webapp maker/remover and defer unless tests make migration safe.
- [x] 7.1 Remove or shrink scripts only after replacement and parity evidence exists (evaluated; cleanup skipped because required runtime/dot/nix parity evidence is incomplete).
- [x] 7.2 Update docs and verification evidence.

## Slice 2 characterization

### Current Lua entrypoint order

`config/shared/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` loads:

1. `lua.monitors`
2. `lua.programs`
3. `lua.autostart`
4. `lua.environment`
5. `lua.permissions`
6. `lua.look-and-feel`
7. `lua.layout`
8. `lua.input`
9. `lua.keybindings` via `.setup(programs)`
10. `lua.windows-workspaces`

### Current Lua modules

- `monitors.lua`: single preferred monitor rule with explicit scale 1.
- `programs.lua`: centralized command strings and compatibility wrapper paths.
- `autostart.lua`: `hyprland.start` event executes startup command list.
- `environment.lua`: pure `hl.env` declarations.
- `permissions.lua`: documented/commented permissions only; no active permission changes.
- `look-and-feel.lua`: general, decoration, animations, curves.
- `layout.lua`: dwindle/master/scrolling/misc config.
- `input.lua`: keyboard/mouse/touchpad plus 3-finger workspace gesture.
- `keybindings.lua`: `setup(programs)` binds compositor actions and existing external wrappers.
- `windows-workspaces.lua`: opacity, utility float/size/center, modal float, XWayland empty class rule.

### Hyprlang fallback order

`config/shared/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf` still sources:

1. `00-monitors.conf`
2. `10-programs.conf`
3. `20-autostart.conf`
4. `30-environment.conf`
5. `40-permissions.conf`
6. `50-look-and-feel.conf`
7. `55-layout.conf`
8. `60-input.conf`
9. `70-keybindings.conf`
10. `80-windows-workspaces.conf`
11. `90-noctalia-colors.conf`

Fallback remains intact. No script, caller, or manifest changed through Slice 3.

## Slice 3 characterization

- Existing Lua modules already own keybindings, monitors, input, look/layout, windows, and workspace behavior.
- No Lua module reorganization was needed; low-churn parity validation was preferred.
- All shell entrypoints referenced by keybindings remain external wrappers.
- Split conf fallback remains active and was brought closer to current Lua behavior:
  - Added `$control_center = ~/.local/bin/hypr-main-menu` to `10-programs.conf`.
  - Added fallback `SUPER+ALT+Space` bind to `$control_center` in `70-keybindings.conf`.
  - Added fallback `scrolling` layout block to `55-layout.conf`.
- Host/manual parity checklist lives in `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/compositor-parity.md`.

## Slice 4 characterization

- `orgm-hypr session import-env --print` prints the same `systemctl --user import-environment ...` and `dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd ...` command shapes as current Lua/hyprlang autostart.
- `internal/session` also characterizes container startup engine selection (`docker` before `podman`) and Discord startup selection (native `discord --start-minimized` before Flatpak). These decisions are typed but not wired into live autostart; old shell autostart remains fallback.
- `orgm-hypr waybar date --format date-es|day-month-es|time-ampm` and `orgm-hypr waybar swap-usage` match current tiny helper outputs. `watch-plan` captures current config/style/log paths. Workspace JSON helper is characterized internally, but live hyprctl status/click wiring stays with existing `hypr-workspace-button` wrapper for now.
- `orgm-hypr dock start --print-args` prints current `hypr-nwg-dock` `nwg-dock-hyprland` argument list. `dock start --reload` has minimal live compatibility behavior, but the existing `hypr-nwg-dock` script remains unchanged and is still the runtime fallback.
- No scripts were deleted or rewritten. No callers were migrated.

## Slice 5 characterization

- `orgm-hypr windows list --clients PATH` prints address + compatibility labels from hyprctl JSON (`[workspace] class — title`). Without `--clients`, it reads `hyprctl -j clients`; existing `fuzzel-hypr-window`, `hypr-kill-windows`, and Walker scripts remain runtime fallback.
- `orgm-hypr windows focus ADDRESS --print` constructs the same Hyprland Lua focus dispatch shape used by current scripts. Non-print execution can run `hyprctl dispatch ...`; no wrapper switched.
- `internal/windows.KillCandidatesFromJSON` characterizes safe kill-menu candidate filtering: unique PID, current-user ownership via injected RSS/ownership probe, RSS threshold, sorted labels. Interactive fuzzel flow remains wrapper-owned.
- `orgm-hypr zen focus --clients PATH --print` chooses the most recent Zen window by `focusHistoryID` from classes `app.zen_browser.zen` and `zen-browser`, then prints the focus dispatch. `zen open-new-window` run behavior is characterized in pure code but not enabled live; existing `hypr-zen-new-window` remains fallback.
- `orgm-hypr osd volume|mic|brightness ACTION --print` prints planned device command and notify-send payload from injected state. Live hardware execution is intentionally deferred to existing `volume-osd`, `mic-volume-osd`, and `brightness-osd` wrappers.
- No scripts were deleted or rewritten. No callers were migrated.

## Slice 6 characterization

- Menu wrappers (`hypr-main-menu`, system/tools/performance/WiFi/Bluetooth/keyboard/power/keybindings) were documented in `menu-webapp-characterization.md` with callers, menu items/actions, dependencies, cancel paths, and retained-script rationale.
- `orgm-hypr smart-run parse QUERY...` and `orgm-hypr smart-run run QUERY... --print` now expose parser decisions without launching GUI/browser/apps. Existing `hypr-smart-run` remains live runtime fallback.
- Smart-run parser captures current shell behavior: trim/no-op, direct URL, localhost URL, ChatGPT/Claude desktop hints, Google/YouTube search hints, executable command, domain URL, and default ChatGPT desktop query.
- Webapp maker/remover were characterized and deferred. Destructive remover profile deletion (`rm -rf`) and maker file/network writes are not migrated in Slice 6.
- No scripts were deleted or rewritten. No callers were migrated.

## Deviations from design

- No Lua module tree reorganization was done. Current `hyprland.lua` and `lua/*.lua` modules already exist and are deterministic, so Slices 2-3 used low-churn documentation and fallback parity edits instead of loader/module churn.
- Manual Hyprland reload/load was not attempted; runtime validation remains blocked/deferred to host verification.
- `nix flake check`, `orgm-dot diff`, and dot wrapper verification remain blocked by unavailable/broken local tooling.
- No script deletion, caller switching, cleanup, or manifest edit by this SDD slice.
- Slice 4 implements safe helper subcommands and pure typed decisions only. It does not switch `waybar-watch`, `hypr-workspace-button`, date/swap scripts, autostart shell snippets, or `hypr-nwg-dock` wrapper to Go yet.
- Slice 5 implements pure typed decision/planning and print-safe CLI only where hardware/GUI/runtime behavior would otherwise be risky. It does not switch `fuzzel-hypr-window`, `hypr-kill-windows`, `walker-window-switch.sh`, `hypr-zen-new-window`, `volume-osd`, `mic-volume-osd`, or `brightness-osd` to Go yet.
- Slice 6 keeps menu wrappers as scripts and webapp maker/remover deferred. Only smart-run parser/print-safe planning moved to Go; live GUI/browser/app execution remains with `hypr-smart-run`.

## Remaining tasks

- No assigned Slice 7 implementation tasks remain.
- Slice 4 live caller migration remains deferred: existing autostart and PATH wrappers still provide runtime behavior until manual parity is verified.
- Slice 5 live caller migration remains deferred: existing windows/Zen/OSD wrappers still provide runtime behavior until manual parity is verified.
- Slice 6 live caller migration remains deferred: existing menu, smart-run, and webapp wrappers still provide runtime behavior until manual parity/destructive-flow tests are verified.
- Script cleanup remains deferred for all in-scope wrappers because replacement + caller migration + parity evidence is incomplete.
- Re-run `nix flake check`, `nix fmt`, Nix builds, `orgm-dot diff --host orgm`, and `./dot.sh diff --host orgm` from environment where `nix`, `orgm-dot`, and working project dot wrapper are available.
- Run manual Hyprland reload/session startup/Waybar/dock/windows/Zen/OSD/menu/smart-run/webapp parity checklist on compatible host runtime.

## Risks / observations

- Unrelated concurrent work remains present: `openspec/changes/orgm-hypr-theme-system/`, `config/shared/.config/orgm-hypr/`, `internal/theme/`, `config/dotfiles.json`, and theme-related files. Slice 4/5 did not intentionally edit those areas.
- Earlier Slice 3 final rerun had reported unrelated concurrent theme compile errors in `internal/theme/plan.go`; after concurrent work progressed, Slice 4 and Slice 5 `go test ./...` passed in this runtime.
- Slice 5 observed unrelated concurrent tracked/untracked project changes still present outside this slice, including `config/dotfiles.json`, Waybar/theme files, `internal/theme/`, `openspec/changes/orgm-hypr-theme-system/`, and other prior SDD slice artifacts.
- Memory/Engram tool unavailable in this executor; discoveries recorded here only.

## Slice 8 progress: command surface normalization and wrapper migration

### Workload / PR boundary

- Delivery path: auto-chain / continuation Slice 8 only.
- PR boundary: command-surface audit, safe Go command surface additions, and safest thin wrapper conversions. Complex menus, smart-run live mode, webapp, OSD live hardware wrappers, and destructive window/session helpers remain deferred to Slice 9/10.

### Completed tasks

- [x] 8.1 Refreshed command-surface audit in `wrapper-migration-audit.md` against current wrappers/callers.
- [x] 8.2 Added RED CLI contract tests for missing safe command names:
  - `orgm-hypr waybar workspace status|click`
  - `orgm-hypr dock start reload --print-args` compatibility alias
  - `orgm-hypr zen open-new-window --print`
  - `orgm-hypr wallpaper current`
- [x] 8.3 Implemented safe command surfaces:
  - `waybar workspace status|click` with file-backed test flags and live `hyprctl -j monitors/workspaces` fallback.
  - `dock start reload|restart` positional compatibility aliases.
  - `zen open-new-window --print` plus live install selection/launch path using existing Zen planner and focus helper.
  - `wallpaper current` compatibility symlink generation/print path.
- [x] 8.4 Converted safest wrappers to no-logic `exec orgm-hypr ... "$@"` wrappers:
  - `waybar-date-es`
  - `waybar-day-month-es`
  - `waybar-time-ampm`
  - `waybar-swap-usage`
  - `hypr-workspace-button`
  - `hypr-nwg-dock`
  - `hypr-zen-new-window`
  - `hypr-current-wallpaper`
  - `hypr-random-wallpaper` was already thin and left unchanged.
- [x] 8.5 Evaluated window/session helper wrapper conversion. No destructive/interactively prompted window/session helper was converted in Slice 8 because cancellation/destructive paths are not fully migrated/tested. Deferrals recorded in `wrapper-migration-audit.md`.

### Files changed in Slice 8

- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main.go` — added `waybar workspace`, dock positional reload aliases, `zen open-new-window`, and `wallpaper current` command routing/helpers.
- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main_test.go` — added CLI contract tests and updated wallpaper usage expectation.
- `internal/wallpaper/manager.go` — added `CompatibilityCurrent` symlink helper used by `wallpaper current`.
- `config/shared/.local/bin/waybar-date-es` — thin exec wrapper.
- `config/shared/.local/bin/waybar-day-month-es` — thin exec wrapper.
- `config/shared/.local/bin/waybar-time-ampm` — thin exec wrapper.
- `config/shared/.local/bin/waybar-swap-usage` — thin exec wrapper.

- `config/shared/.local/bin/hypr-current-wallpaper` — thin exec wrapper.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/wrapper-migration-audit.md` — refreshed wrapper/caller/canonical command audit.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/continuation-tasks.md` — Slice 8 checkboxes marked complete/evaluated.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/apply-progress.md` — this progress entry.

### Deviations / deferrals

- OSD wrappers were not converted because `orgm-hypr osd` remains print-only and live hardware/query/notify behavior is not safely implemented in Slice 8.
- `fuzzel-hypr-window`, `hypr-kill-windows`, and `walker-window-switch.sh` were not converted because prompt cancellation/destructive kill flows need Slice 9/10 tests.
- Menu wrappers, smart-run live wrapper, and webapp maker/remover remain behavior-owning scripts pending Slice 9 tests and destructive/file-write safety gates.
- Repo-owned callers still use compatibility wrapper names; caller migration is reserved for Slice 10 after wrapper parity evidence.
- `nix`, `orgm-dot`, and project-local `./dot.sh` verification remain blocked in this runtime.

### Remaining tasks after Slice 8

- Slice 9: interactive menu/webapp migration, smart-run live mode, and destructive/file-write safety tests.
- Slice 10: caller migration to direct `orgm-hypr ...` commands, wrapper keep/remove audit, and final cleanup verification.

## Slice 9 progress: interactive menu/webapp migration

### Workload / PR boundary

- Delivery path: auto-chain / continuation Slice 9 only.
- PR boundary: menu/smart-run/webapp command ownership plus safe wrapper conversions. Webapp maker/remover wrappers remain behavior-owning and deferred because no-arg interactive prompt parity is not implemented in Go.

### Completed tasks

- [x] 9.1 Added RED characterization tests for menu models/actions in `internal/menu/menu_test.go` and CLI menu tests.
- [x] 9.2 Implemented `orgm-hypr menu main|system|tools|performance|wifi|bluetooth|keyboard|power|keybindings` with pure model/action planning, rofi execution boundary, `--print`, `--select`, and destructive `--confirm` gates.
- [x] 9.3 Converted menu wrappers to thin exec wrappers: `hypr-main-menu`, `hypr-system-menu`, `hypr-tools-menu`, `hypr-performance-menu`, `hypr-wifi-menu`, `hypr-bluetooth-menu`, `hypr-keyboard-menu`, `hypr-power-menu`, `hypr-keybindings-help`.
- [x] 9.4 Expanded `orgm-hypr smart-run run` to live execution planning/execution, with `--print` parser plan and `--print-exec` command plan; converted `hypr-smart-run` to thin wrapper.
- [x] 9.5 Implemented `orgm-hypr webapp list|create|remove` with dry-run/list/fake filesystem tests and profile deletion confirmation gate. Maker/remover wrappers kept deferred.

### Files changed in Slice 9

- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main.go` — added menu, webapp, and smart-run execution command routing/helpers.
- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main_test.go` — added CLI tests for menu selected actions/destructive gates, webapp dry-run/list, and smart-run execution print plan.
- `internal/menu/menu.go` / `internal/menu/menu_test.go` — new pure menu data/action model and keybinding category data.
- `internal/webapp/webapp.go` / `internal/webapp/webapp_test.go` — new webapp slug/url/create/list/remove planning with destructive profile gate.
- `internal/smartrun/smartrun.go` / `internal/smartrun/smartrun_test.go` — added execution planning for browser, desktop, clipboard, and command actions.
- Menu wrappers and smart-run wrapper under `config/shared/.local/bin/` — converted to thin `exec orgm-hypr ...` delegators.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/continuation-tasks.md` — marked Slice 9 complete/evaluated.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/wrapper-migration-audit.md` — updated converted/deferred wrapper evidence.

### Deviations / deferrals

- Webapp maker/remover wrappers were not converted. Go now owns dry-run/list/create/remove planning and live non-interactive file writes/deletes, but existing wrappers still provide no-arg rofi prompts. Converting them would break current interactive UX; defer until Slice 10 or follow-up adds `orgm-hypr webapp create/remove` interactive prompt parity.
- `hypr-keybindings-help` is now thin to `orgm-hypr menu keybindings`; this exposes keybinding data through `orgm-hypr`, but old interactive category/copy loop parity needs manual review in Slice 10.
- `hypr-performance-menu` dynamic `command -v` filtering was replaced by static Go model. This removes shell ownership but needs Slice 10 manual parity check on host PATH.
- Menu rofi theme/scaling details moved out of shell wrappers and are not fully reimplemented; live smoke is deferred by runtime constraints.
- `nix`, `orgm-dot`, and project-local `./dot.sh` verification remain blocked in this runtime.

### Remaining tasks after Slice 9

- Slice 10 caller migration to direct canonical `orgm-hypr ...` commands.
- Slice 10 wrapper keep/remove audit, especially webapp maker/remover, OSD wrappers, window prompt wrappers, and keybinding/menu parity notes.
- Manual Hyprland/menu/smart-run/webapp smoke tests in host runtime.

## Slice 10 progress: caller migration and cleanup verification

### Workload / PR boundary

- Delivery path: auto-chain / continuation Slice 10 only.
- PR boundary: caller migration to canonical `orgm-hypr ...` commands, thin-wrapper conversion for remaining safe domains, audit/docs/partial verification. No wrapper removal or manifest cleanup was performed because external compatibility and manual host parity are not fully proven.

### Completed tasks

- [x] 10.1 Updated Hypr Lua and hyprlang fallback callers to canonical `orgm-hypr` command names where safe.
- [x] 10.2 Audited wrappers for keep/remove/defer decisions in `wrapper-migration-audit.md`.
- [x] 10.3 Ran cleanup gate: no removals; converted safe wrappers to thin exec; deferred exact exceptions.
- [x] 10.4 Updated final continuation verification report.

### Files changed in Slice 10

- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main.go` — added live/print command surfaces for `waybar watch`, `session start-containers`, `session start-discord`, `windows switch`, `windows kill-menu`, and live OSD execution.
- `cmd/orgm-hypr/main_test.go` — added RED/GREEN CLI tests for Slice 10 command surfaces.
- `config/shared/.config/hypr/lua/programs.lua` — canonical menu/smart-run/power command names.
- `config/shared/.config/hypr/lua/keybindings.lua` — canonical Zen, smart-run, menu, OSD, and window commands.
- `config/shared/.config/hypr/lua/autostart.lua` — canonical session/Waybar/dock autostart commands.
- `config/shared/.config/hypr/10-programs.conf`, `20-autostart.conf`, `70-keybindings.conf` — hyprlang fallback caller migration.
- `config/shared/.config/waybar/config`, `config/shared/.config/waybar-hypr/config` — Waybar module/menu caller migration to `orgm-hypr`.
- `config/shared/.local/bin/waybar-watch`, `volume-osd`, `mic-volume-osd`, `brightness-osd`, `fuzzel-hypr-window`, `hypr-kill-windows`, `config/shared/.config/hypr/scripts/walker-window-switch.sh` — converted to thin exec wrappers.
- `config/shared/.config/hypr/lua/README.md` — updated caller/wrapper contract.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/continuation-tasks.md` — Slice 10 tasks marked complete.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/wrapper-migration-audit.md` — final wrapper/caller status and exceptions.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/verify-report.md` — Slice 10 verification addendum.
- `openspec/changes/hypr-lua-orgm-hypr-migration/apply-progress.md` — this entry.

### Callers migrated

- Hypr Lua and fallback config now call `orgm-hypr menu main|power|keybindings`, `orgm-hypr smart-run run`, `orgm-hypr zen open-new-window`, `orgm-hypr windows switch|kill-menu`, `orgm-hypr osd volume|mic|brightness`, `orgm-hypr session import-env|start-containers|start-discord`, `orgm-hypr waybar watch`, and `orgm-hypr dock start` for migrated domains.
- Waybar configs now call `orgm-hypr waybar date|swap-usage|workspace` and `orgm-hypr menu ...` directly instead of compatibility wrappers.

### Wrappers converted / deferred

- Converted in Slice 10: `waybar-watch`, `volume-osd`, `mic-volume-osd`, `brightness-osd`, `fuzzel-hypr-window`, `hypr-kill-windows`, `walker-window-switch.sh`.
- Kept as thin compatibility wrappers from earlier slices: Waybar tiny helpers, workspace button, dock, Zen, wallpaper, menu wrappers, and smart-run wrapper.
- Deferred behavior-owning exceptions: `hypr-webapp-maker`, `hypr-webapp-remover` (no-arg interactive rofi UX not implemented in Go).
- Out-of-scope behavior-owning utilities: `hypr-fuzzel`, `hypr-lock`, `hypr-focus-notification-app`, `fuzzel-open-file*`, `fuzzel-ssh-host`, `fuzzel-tmux-arch`, `fuzzel-calc`, `pi-walker-prompt.sh`, and non-Hypr `sway/config` `waybar-watch` caller.

### Deviations / blockers

- No wrappers were removed from the manifest; compatibility wrappers remain because external callers and manual host parity are not fully proven.
- Webapp maker/remover wrappers remain behavior-owning because converting them would break current no-arg interactive rofi prompt flow. Required follow-up: `orgm-hypr webapp create/remove --interactive` or equivalent prompt flags.
- Generic fuzzel/file/tmux/calc/Pi/lock/notification helpers remain out of scope for this SDD change; exact exceptions are listed in `wrapper-migration-audit.md`.
- `nix`, `orgm-dot`, and project-local `./dot.sh` remain blocked in this runtime; no `orgm-dot sync` was run.
